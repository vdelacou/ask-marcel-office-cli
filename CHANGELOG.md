# Changelog

All notable changes to `ask-marcel-office-cli` are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Fixed: a re-bordered table names the property that changed

`formatChanges` compared a property by its OWN attributes, which is all a
`w:b` or a `w:color` has. `w:tblBorders` carries nothing itself and hangs every
value off a child element, so both sides of a re-bordered table signed as the
empty string and the revision was reported with its author and scope but no
property named. That is the commonest table revision there is, shipped that way
in 2.5.0 and recorded as a known limit at the time.

The signature now descends into child elements, and into repeated children in
order. The five scopes share this comparison, so runs and paragraphs gain the
same reach; nothing about their existing output changed.

## 2.5.0

### Fixed: `help` costs the same whoever runs it

The top-level listing is compacted to fit an LLM's token budget, and then
Commander sized its description column from `process.stdout.columns`, so the
budget depended on the reader's terminal. Measured on this surface: 35 KB at 80
columns, 64 KB at 100, 46 KB at 140, 39 KB at 200. Not even monotonic, so no
width was safe to assume.

The wrap width is now pinned at 80 and the listing is 35 KB everywhere.

This also broke `npm publish`. The byte-count guard in `cli.test.ts` asserts the
listing stays under 45 KB, and under CI or any piped run stdout is not a TTY, so
Commander fell back to 80 and the guard passed. Run from an ordinary terminal at
90 to 150 columns it failed, which is where most terminals sit. A new test
renders the listing at four widths and asserts one size, so the guard can no
longer measure a different thing for each reader.

### Fixed: the group conversation collections stop advertising a filter Graph refuses

`list-group-threads` and `list-group-conversations` handed out the full OData
option set, so both advertised `--filter`. Graph accepts it on neither. Probed
live on a group the signed-in user belongs to: any predicate on the threads
collection answers `ConversationFilterOther`, `isLocked eq false` answers
`ConversationFilterIsLockedEqualsFalse` because the only accepted forms are
`IsLocked eq true` and `IsLocked ne false`, and a predicate on conversations
answers `ErrorUnsupportedPathForQuery`.

That broke the promise the usage guide makes, that the CLI advertises only the
flags the endpoint honours so the manifest never lies. An agent reading the
manifest spent a round trip to find out. `--filter` is dropped from both; the
flag is now refused locally with the unknown-flag hint and no network call.
Filtering a group inbox down to its locked threads is not a use this CLI has,
so the one working predicate did not earn a caveat in its place.

`--top`, `--skip`, `--orderby`, `--select` and `--expand` are all honoured on
both collections and are unchanged.

### Added: docx tracked changes cover the table

`extractDocxMetadata` reported formatting revisions on runs and paragraphs only,
so a reviewer who restyled a table left no trace in the metadata block. Word
records a table, row and cell property change the same way it records a run's,
the properties as they were BEFORE the edit nested inside a `*Change` element,
so the same walker reads all five. `formatChanges[].scope` gains `table`, `row`
and `cell` alongside `run` and `paragraph`.

One limit worth knowing: a property whose values hang off child elements rather
than its own attributes, and `w:tblBorders` is the common table case, compares
as unchanged. The revision is still reported with its author, date and scope; it
names no property. Structural revisions (`w:cellIns`, `w:cellDel`, `w:cellMerge`)
carry no before/after pair and are not reported.

### Added: a gate that holds the docs to the registry's numbers

Four numeric claims drifted during the 2.4.0 cycle, and one was wrong on main for
two releases: `docs/USAGE.md` promised "the 180 READ commands" where the registry
held 188, three sections after `README.md` said 188 correctly. `mcp.ts` already
derives its counts and carries a comment saying the prose must be derived too;
nothing enforced it.

`bun run check:docs` reads the counts off the command registry and the rendered
manifest, then holds all ten numeric claims in `README.md`, `docs/USAGE.md` and
`docs/COMMANDS.md` to them, printing `file:line expected N, found M`. A claim
whose anchor text no longer matches anything fails too, so rewording a sentence
cannot silently switch its own check off. It runs in CI behind a `--selftest`
that proves the matcher rejects both a wrong number and a lost anchor.

The stale 188 is corrected in the same change.

### Added: read what is attached to a group post

`get-group-post --expand attachments` was the only route to a post's attachments,
and it inlines every one of them at once, which is the shape that times out on a
post carrying a multi-MB file. Three commands make the group inbox readable
attachment by attachment, all on the `Group.Read.All` scope the token already has:

- `list-group-post-attachments` returns the metadata alone, with the same slim
  default `--select` the mail and calendar siblings use. Graph silently ignores
  `$top`, `$skip`, `$orderby` and `$filter` here (probed live: asking for one
  attachment returned all seven, and `isInline eq false` returned all seven when
  every one was inline), so only `--select` and `--expand` are exposed.
- `get-group-post-attachment` fetches one attachment, mirroring `contentBytes`
  as `base64` so `--output-path` lands it on disk. This is also the route to an
  image attached to a post.
- `convert-group-post-attachment-to-markdown` renders one through the shared
  conversion pipeline, the way the mail and calendar siblings do.

### Fixed: unconvertible attachments name a command that can reach them

The shared conversion pipeline hardcoded the mail remediation wording, so an
image or scanned PDF attached to a calendar event told the caller to run
`get-mail-attachment --message-id ...`, which cannot address an event. Each
caller now supplies its own hints: the calendar converter points at
`get-calendar-event --expand attachments` and its PDF sibling, and the new post
converter points at `get-group-post-attachment`.

### Fixed: inline-only mail no longer hides its images

Graph reports `hasAttachments: false` for a message whose only attachments are
inline images, and both markdown converters fetched the attachment list only on
that flag. Such a message rendered its images as unnamed placeholders, left them
out of the attachments list, and embedded nothing under `--inline-images true`.
The list is now fetched whenever the body references a `cid:` image as well,
the guard `get-mail-signature` already uses, so
`convert-mail-to-markdown` and `convert-group-post-to-markdown` name the
placeholders, list the images with their ids, and embed them on request. No
extra call for a message without inline images.

### Changed: the shared-mailbox commands say when they will 403

`list-shared-mailbox-messages`, `list-shared-mailbox-folder-messages`,
`list-shared-mailbox-folders`, `list-shared-mailbox-child-folders` and
`get-shared-mailbox-message` used to promise a 403 only "if the signed-in user
does not have shared access". The scope they need, `Mail.Read.Shared`, is on
neither token this CLI can mint, so their summaries now state that any mailbox
other than your own is expected to answer `ErrorAccessDenied` whatever delegation
Exchange holds, that your own UPN works, and that a Microsoft 365 group's mailbox
is the shared-mail path that does.

### Added: read the posts of a Microsoft 365 group conversation

`list-group-conversations` and `list-group-threads` stopped at Graph's truncated
`preview`, and a group mailbox cannot be read through the shared-mailbox commands
(`ErrorGroupIsUsedInNonGroupURI`), so a group's mail was reachable up to its titles
and no further. Three commands close the gap, all on the `Group.Read.All` scope the
token already carries:

- `list-group-thread-posts --group-id --thread-id` returns every `post` of a thread
  with its HTML body, `from`, `sender`, `receivedDateTime` and `hasAttachments`.
  Graph hands back the whole thread in one call and silently ignores `$top`, `$skip`
  and `$orderby` while rejecting `$filter` (probed live), so only `--select` and
  `--expand` are exposed and there is no page cursor.
- `get-group-post --group-id --thread-id --post-id` is the `get-mail-message` sibling
  for a group inbox; `--expand attachments` inlines the attachments with their bytes.
- `convert-group-post-to-markdown` renders one post the way `convert-mail-to-markdown`
  renders a message, with the same `--inline-images` and `--keep-quoted` flags. A post
  arrives from the group's own address with the writer in `sender`, so the author line
  reads `Robin Chen <...> on behalf of Support <...>`; the thread `topic` is the subject
  and is not repeated.

The mail-to-markdown pipeline now takes the resource path and the header renderer as
parameters; the mail command's output is unchanged. `list-group-threads` and
`list-group-conversations` point at the reader, and at `--expand posts`, which already
inlined the bodies.

### Fixed — deleted text no longer renders in an `.odt` body

The body converter walked `text:tracked-changes` like any other block, so the
paragraphs a reviewer had deleted printed as if they were still in the
document. The region is skipped, so the body reads as the document stands.

## 2.4.0

Two community fixes from [@a-tokyo](https://github.com/a-tokyo). Nothing breaks:
the new flag is optional, and every existing invocation routes exactly as before.

### Fixed — share links whose filename is not ASCII

`buildShareToken` fed the raw URL string to `btoa`, which only accepts Latin-1.
A sharing URL with an accented filename minted a token that resolved to nothing,
and one with a CJK or emoji filename threw `InvalidCharacterError`, which crashed
the command from inside `Promise.all`. The URL's UTF-8 bytes are now encoded
before base64url, which is what Graph's `/shares/{token}` resolver expects.

Six commands build that token and all six were affected:

| Command | How it reaches the token |
|---------|--------------------------|
| `resolve-drive-share-link` | encodes the sharing URL directly |
| `convert-mail-attachment-to-markdown` | resolves an attachment's source URL |
| `convert-mail-attachment-to-pdf` | resolves an attachment's source URL |
| `extract-mail-attachment-images` | resolves an attachment's source URL |
| `extract-sharepoint-links-in-mail` | one resolve per link found in the body |
| `extract-sharepoint-links-in-documents` | one resolve per link found in the text |

The byte-to-base64 step moved into a shared `bytesToBase64` codec under
`domain/utilities`, replacing the private copy that lived in `fetch-raw-bytes`.

### Added — `next-page --tenant-id`

`next-page` re-signs a cursor to match the identity its originating command used,
but it knew only two: the home basic token and the elevated chat token. A
partner-tenant drive listing signs page 1 with a guest token, and the
`@odata.nextLink` it emits carries no tenant, so page 2 was re-signed with the
home token and Graph answered `401 invalidAudienceUri`. Anything longer than one
page in a partner tenant was unreadable past page 1.

Pass the same `--tenant-id` you gave the originating command (ultimately from
`resolve-drive-share-link`) and the cursor is re-signed with a guest token for
that tenant. The flag reuses the existing `tenant-option` branding, so a
malformed GUID is rejected at the boundary before any Graph call.

The footer carries the flag for you. `next:` and `delta:` both render
`--tenant-id <guid>` whenever the call that produced the cursor used one, so the
line stays copy-pasteable rather than becoming a 401 one step later. This is the
line an MCP agent reads to build its next call, not just a terminal convenience.

### Added — docx tracked changes report replacements as one edit

OOXML has no "replace" revision: Word records replacing a span as a deletion
sitting next to an insertion. Reported as two loose halves, one edit read as an
unrelated cut plus an unrelated addition somewhere else, with nothing linking
them. A deletion and an insertion that are adjacent siblings by the same author
now come back as a single `replacements` entry carrying `before` and `after`,
and the two halves leave `insertions` / `deletions` so nothing is counted twice.
The markdown output gains a `### Tracked changes — replacements` section above
the two existing ones.

Adjacency is real document order, not a guess. The default XML parse groups
same-named siblings per tag, which cannot distinguish del, ins, del, ins from
del, del, ins, ins, so revisions are re-read through a second order-preserving
parser. Pairing is scoped to siblings of one parent, requires the same author on
both halves, and treats Word's glyph-free markers (`w:proofErr`, bookmark and
comment anchors) as not separating a pair, while any untouched run of prose does.

Still unreported, unchanged by this: `w:moveFrom` / `w:moveTo`, `w:rPrChange`,
`w:pPrChange`, and the table-structure revisions. A document whose only tracked
edit is a formatting change still reports no tracked changes at all.

### Added — docx moves and formatting changes are reported at all

A docx whose only tracked edits were a moved paragraph or a reformat reported
no tracked changes whatsoever, which reads as a clean document rather than an
unreviewed one. `w:moveFrom` / `w:moveTo` and `w:rPrChange` / `w:pPrChange` are
now extracted into two new sections.

`moves` joins the two ends of a move through the `w:name` on the range-start
markers that bracket them, not by matching their text: Word does guarantee the
halves carry identical content, so text-matching looks free right up to a
document that moves the same sentence twice and silently cross-pairs four halves
into two moves that never happened. A half whose partner is missing still gets a
row, marked `from-only` or `to-only`.

`formatChanges` names which properties a reviewer altered, comparing attributes
as well as tag names. `w:color` sits on both sides of a recolour with only its
`w:val` moving, so a comparison of tag names alone calls that run unchanged.
Run-level and paragraph-level changes share one list, separated by `scope`.

Table-structure revisions (cell insert / delete / merge, numbering, section and
table properties) remain unreported, and the `--include-metadata` docs now say
so rather than leaving it to be discovered.

### Added — `get-mail-signature` empty states carry an `errorCode`

Finding no signature used to come back as a validation error with a good
message and no code, so an agent routing on `errorCode` saw nothing and the
live QA sweep logged it as `ERR:err`. Two codes now name the two distinct
misses: `signature_not_found` when the scanned or pinned message carries no
OWA signature block, and `no_sent_messages` when there is nothing to scan at
all. The messages are unchanged.

### Fixed — `scopes-check` never opens a browser

`scopes-check` obtained the basic token through the same acquiring getter as
every other command, and in a terminal that getter heals an expired session by
opening a browser; when the persistent profile is already signed in it also
clears the session so the OAuth grant can re-fire, which drops the 90-day
"Stay signed in" cookie. A diagnostic did all of that on 2026-09-02. The basic
tier is now read straight off the cache like the elevated and Teams tiers
already were: an expired token reports a negative `expiresInSeconds`, an empty
cache reports not-signed-in, and `login` remains the command that refreshes.
Bring-your-own-token managers built with `createGraphClient` are unaffected.

### Added — an `invalidAudienceUri` error hint

The one 401 that re-authenticating cannot fix now says so. Graph cannot mint a
SharePoint token for a tenant you are only a guest in, so an agent told to run
`login` here loops forever. The hint names `--tenant-id`, points at
`resolve-drive-share-link` for the GUID, and covers the paginated case where the
cursor carries no tenant of its own. It sits above the token-expiry rule, which
would otherwise claim the same 401 and give the wrong advice.

## 2.3.0

> **Read this before upgrading.** This release contains breaking changes to the
> flag surface despite the minor version number. If you pin `^2.2.0` you will
> receive it automatically. Anything calling the CLI, the MCP gateway, or the
> library with an old flag spelling will stop working.

### Removed — every flag alias and every deprecated command name

One name per flag, one name per command. The alias system is gone: 77 flag
aliases and 4 deprecated command names. Each alias already pointed at a more
specific canonical, so nothing was renamed to accommodate the removal.

| Gone | Use instead |
|------|-------------|
| `--id` (51 commands) | the command's specific id flag (`--message-id`, `--site-id`, …) |
| `--start` / `--end` (7 date-window commands) | `--start-date-time` / `--end-date-time` |
| `--body-content` on `create-reply-draft` / `create-forward-draft` | `--comment` |
| `--task-id` | `--planner-task-id` or `--todo-task-id` |
| `--folder-id` | `--item-id` |
| `--item-id` on the SharePoint list commands | `--list-item-id` |
| `--page-id`, `--section-id` | `--onenote-page-id`, `--onenote-section-id` |
| `--emails` on `get-schedule` | `--schedules` |
| `--query` on `search-onenote-pages` | *(now the canonical name, see below)* |
| `download-onedrive-file-content` | `download-drive-item-content` |
| `convert-local-file` | `convert-local-file-to-markdown` |
| `convert-drive-item-zip` | `convert-drive-item-zip-to-markdown` |
| `convert-mail-attachment-zip` | `convert-mail-attachment-zip-to-markdown` |

Why: the same spelling meant different things on sibling commands. That is how
`--body-content` came to mean "the text above the quote" on the create-draft
commands and "replace the ENTIRE body, quote included" on `update-mail-draft`,
a silent data-loss trap fixed in this same release.

### Changed — `search-onenote-pages --title-substring` is now `--query`

The last flag naming a shared concept differently from its siblings. All eight
search commands now take `--query`. (`--query` had already been bolted onto this
command as an alias for exactly this reason; it is now the only name.) The flag
still matches page TITLES only, which its description states explicitly.

### Changed — a parameter a command does not declare is now refused

Previously the three surfaces disagreed. Commander rejected unknown `--flags` on
the CLI, but Zod strips unknown keys, so the MCP gateway's `run-command` params
and direct library `commands[x].execute(...)` calls silently swallowed them and
returned data that looked like it had obeyed. A live audit found this on 5 of 7
delta commands. All three surfaces now refuse identically, with
`errorCode: "unknown_parameter"` and the supported flags named in the message.

### Fixed — `--top` no longer terminates a mail-folder delta sync

`list-mail-folder-messages-delta --top 2` on a 67-message Inbox returned 2
messages and an `@odata.deltaLink` rather than a `nextLink`. Graph reads a
*satisfied* `$top` as "this sync is complete", so the other 65 messages were
never delivered and the caller banked a delta token certifying a sync that never
happened. `--top` is now sent as `Prefer: odata.maxpagesize`, which pages
normally. `--skip` and `--orderby` are no longer advertised there (Graph ignores
the first and rejects the second), and `--filter` / `--orderby` are gone from
the two drive delta commands for the same reason.

### Fixed — a whole-body draft update can no longer drop quoted history

`update-mail-draft --body-content` on a threaded draft replaced the entire body
including the quoted thread, with nothing warning at call time. It now reads the
draft first and refuses when a quote is present, pointing at `--comment`. Pass
`--replace-quoted-history true` for the deliberate case. The same read refuses
non-drafts before the write.

### Fixed — the oversized-response banner only names remedies that exist

The `sizeHint` banner called `--output-path` a "universal remedy (works on every
command)". It is not: plain-JSON commands refuse the flag, and the two commands
that trip the banner most often (`search-all-files`, `microsoft-search-query`)
advertise only `--query`, so every remedy it named was a dead end. The banner is
now derived from the command that produced the payload and the surface asking:
byte-producing commands keep the `--output-path` wording (`outputPath` on MCP),
plain-JSON commands on the CLI get a shell redirect, and the same commands on
MCP get neither, since an MCP client has no shell.

## 2.2.0

### Added

- **`ask-marcel-office mcp` — serve the whole CLI to any MCP client over stdio.** Hosts
  without a shell (Claude Desktop, other MCP clients) can now reach every
  command. Register it with:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user ask-marcel-office -- ask-marcel-office mcp
  ```

  It exposes **five gateway tools**, not one per command — 183 tool schemas
  would inject hundreds of KB into every session, the exact token bloat this
  CLI exists to avoid:

  - `list-commands` — the terse manifest (`{name, summary, category}`),
    optionally filtered to one category. The discovery entry point.
  - `get-command-docs` — full Markdown docs for a single command: every option,
    its Graph endpoint, an example, the response shape. Lifecycle commands and
    deprecated command names both resolve.
  - `run-command` — runs any of the **179 read** commands. Declared
    `readOnlyHint: true`, so an MCP client can auto-approve it; a write routed
    here is refused *before* it executes.
  - `run-write-command` — runs the **4** mail-draft write commands
    (`create-mail-draft`, `create-forward-draft`, `create-reply-draft`,
    `update-mail-draft`). A separate tool precisely so the 179 read commands
    keep an honest read-only annotation. Marked non-destructive: every write
    produces an UNSENT draft, and this CLI still cannot send mail.
  - `login` — sign in or refresh. The elevated (M365) token lapses roughly
    hourly and only a browser can recapture it, so this saves a terminal
    round-trip mid-session.

  Both run tools accept `outputPath` / `outputDir`, mirroring the CLI flags, so
  a multi-MB PDF lands on disk instead of flooding the model's context.

  **Raise your MCP client's tool timeout to ~5 minutes** (`MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=300000`
  or equivalent). Measured against a real tenant: a browser sign-in takes
  **37–64 s even with no MFA prompt**, while the MCP default request timeout is
  **60 s** — so `login` times out intermittently at the default. The server keeps
  running through a client-side timeout, so the sign-in has usually completed
  anyway; re-run your original command before calling `login` again. Sign in
  from a terminal the first time (`ask-marcel-office login`), where an MFA prompt adds
  minutes on top.

  Read/write sets are derived from the registry's `mutates` flag, so a new
  command lands on the correct tool with no code change here.

- **Files in a partner tenant you are a guest in are now readable.** Previously
  every such read died at `401 invalidAudienceUri: Invalid audience Uri
  '00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000'` (SharePoint Online's app id): your
  home-tenant Graph cannot mint a SharePoint token for a foreign tenant, so no
  home-tier token could reach the file — which is exactly the case when a partner
  sends you a "Copy link" URL.

  **`resolve-drive-share-link` crosses the boundary by itself.** It tries your
  home token and, only on that specific error, identifies the owning tenant from
  the URL host (`contoso.sharepoint.com` → `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` → the
  tenant's public OIDC discovery document) and retries with a guest token minted
  by redeeming your existing refresh token against that tenant's authority. No
  new sign-in, no browser, no Azure app. It returns the tenant as **`tenantId`**;
  the field's PRESENCE is the signal — absent means the file is in your own
  tenant and nothing changes.

  **`--tenant-id` carries it to the rest of the family.** `driveId` and `itemId`
  carry no tenant, so the commands that consume them cannot recover on their own;
  pass the `tenantId` that `resolve-drive-share-link` returned and they sign with
  the guest token instead. Available on `get-drive-item`,
  `download-drive-item-content`, `download-drive-item-as-markdown`,
  `download-drive-item-as-pdf`, `extract-drive-item-images`,
  `convert-drive-item-zip`, `get-drive-item-list-item`, `list-folder-files`,
  `list-drive-item-versions`, `list-drive-item-permissions`, and
  `list-drive-item-thumbnails`. Optional everywhere; omit it for your own tenant.

  Boundaries worth knowing: a link you simply may not read still fails with
  `accessDenied` (a guest token would not help, so one is never requested); a
  tenant that has not consented to this client, or where you are not actually a
  guest, fails with a message naming that tenant; a SharePoint host whose sign-in
  domain differs from its name cannot be resolved and says so (`--tenant-id`
  passed by hand still works there); and `1drv.ms` belongs to no tenant at all,
  so it is unaffected. Elevated commands do not take the flag — the elevated
  token is a home-tenant identity, so "elevated in a partner tenant" does not
  exist. Verified end to end against a real partner tenant.

- **`get-user`** looks up a directory user by id, UPN/email, or name — one
  command, two routes. An **Azure AD id, UPN, or email** returns that user's FULL
  profile via `GET /users/{id}` on the elevated M365 token (`User.Read.All`, so
  `jobTitle` / `department` / `officeLocation` / phones are populated); it honours
  `--select` / `--expand` and fail-fasts with `secondary_token_unavailable` when
  the elevated token is cold (run `login --force`). An email that is the user's
  `mail` but not their sign-in UPN — every **guest / B2B** user, whose UPN is the
  `alias_homeorg#EXT#@tenant` form — still resolves: when the direct
  `GET /users/{id}` 404s, the command falls back to
  `GET /users?$filter=mail eq '<email>'` and returns the single match. A bare **name** instead
  searches the signed-in user's relevant-people graph
  (`GET /me/people?$search="name"`) on the basic token — so it works even when the
  elevated token is cold — and returns candidate matches
  (`{ id, displayName, mail, jobTitle, department }`) so the caller can
  disambiguate and re-query by the chosen `id` for the full card. Name search
  covers your people graph, not the whole tenant; `microsoft-search-query` remains
  the broad tenant-wide person search. (181st command.)

### Changed

- **Command execution is now shared by both front ends.** The per-command
  handler (alias normalization, local-filesystem routing, error-source
  classification, `--output-path` / `--output-dir` persistence) moved out of
  `cli.ts` into `composition/run-registry-command.ts`, which the CLI and the MCP
  gateway both call. Behaviour is unchanged — the existing CLI suite passes
  untouched — but a future fix now reaches both surfaces instead of one.
- **The output envelope logic is now pure and reusable.** `presenter/output.ts`
  wrote directly to stdout, which an MCP stdio server cannot do (stdout is its
  JSON-RPC channel). The envelope layer moved to `presenter/render-to-string.ts`
  (`renderToString` / `renderErrorToString`); `output.ts` is a thin stdout shim
  over it. Output is byte-identical. MCP callers therefore get the same
  `hint:` / `source:` remedies the terminal does.

- **`scopes-check` is now the single detailed token-status view.** Per token
  (basic / elevated / chatsvcagg / ic3) it reports the `available` flag,
  seconds-to-expiry, `refresh` route (`automatic` = self-heals from the shared
  refresh token; `interactive` = the elevated token, needs a browser login), and
  — new — that token's OWN granted scopes, decoded from its `scp` claim. The four
  tokens carry distinct scope sets (basic ~31 Graph scopes, elevated ~20,
  chatsvcagg `user_impersonation`, ic3 `Teams.AccessAsUser.All`), so an agent can
  intersect each tier against a command's `scopesRequired`. Additive and
  non-breaking: the flat top-level `scopes`/`audience`/`expiresAt`/`expiresInSeconds`
  (the basic token) are unchanged. A `hint` field names a forced re-login as the
  single refresh action.
- **`login` slimmed to an auth confirmation.** It now prints
  `{ status: "authenticated", available: [...], hint }` — which token tiers are
  available, plus a pointer to `scopes-check` (per-token detail) and `login --force`
  (refresh) — instead of the four-token detail block from 2.1.0, and the confusing
  refresh-mechanism hint is gone. The detailed per-token status now lives only in
  `scopes-check`. (Dropping login's `tokens` block is the one breaking-ish change;
  it shipped a single release earlier and the same detail is fully available via
  `scopes-check`.)
- **The mail read commands now include `conversationId` in their default
  projection.** `list-mail-messages`, `search-mail-messages`, and
  `get-mail-message` add `conversationId` to their slim default `--select`, so a
  caller can group results into a thread — or hand the id straight to
  `list-conversation-messages` — without a second round-trip. The three
  previously-duplicated default-select strings are now one shared constant
  (`mail-message-select.ts`) so they cannot drift apart again. Additive
  (~76 bytes/message); a user-supplied `--select` still overrides entirely.
- **`resolve-drive-share-link` now resolves a sharing URL to the driveItem in one
  call.** It previously only encoded the URL into the `u!` share token (offline,
  no Graph call), forcing a second `/shares/{token}/driveItem` fetch plus
  hand-parsing `parentReference.driveId`. It now encodes AND fetches, returning
  `{ driveId, itemId, name, webUrl, size, lastModifiedDateTime, shareToken }` — the
  two ids every `*-drive-item` command needs, in one shot (basic token,
  `Files.Read.All`). Shape + behavior change: it now makes a Graph call and no
  longer returns `graphPath`/`originalUrl`; a cross-tenant or no-access link
  surfaces the Graph `accessDenied` / `itemNotFound` instead of a share token that
  would only fail on the follow-up call.

### Fixed

- **`login` no longer sends you round a loop it cannot break.** A command needing
  the elevated (M365) token failed with "run `ask-marcel-office login`"; `login`
  answered `authenticated` and changed nothing; the command failed identically.
  Forever. The elevated token carries no refresh token of its own, so a plain
  `login` that found a valid cached basic token returned on the cache rung
  without ever re-capturing it — `--force` was the only escape, and the error
  message never said so.

  `login` now re-captures the elevated token whenever it is missing, and does
  nothing when it is already present (no gratuitous browser). The fail-fast
  message now names the right remedy per tier and explains why: `--force` for
  elevated, plain `login` for the chatsvcagg / ic3 substrate tokens, which
  self-heal from the shared refresh token and never needed a browser at all.
  `scopes-check`'s hint and the README carried the same false "only way" claim and
  are corrected too. `--force` still works and still re-captures every tier.

- **The library's documented `AuthManager` example did not compile.** The README's
  "bring your own token" snippet passed `{getAccessToken, logout}` to
  `createGraphClient` and called `AuthManager` "two async methods"; it has ten.
  The snippet now compiles, and declines the tiers a custom token source cannot
  mint rather than omitting them.

- **Guest / external-user (B2B) lookups by UPN now resolve.** A guest UPN is
  `alice_contoso.com#EXT#@fabrikam.onmicrosoft.com`, and the `#` is the URL
  fragment delimiter — the seven commands that put a caller-supplied `userId`
  in a `/users/{id}` path (`get-user-manager`, `get-shared-mailbox-message`,
  `list-shared-mailbox-messages`, `list-shared-mailbox-folder-messages`,
  `list-shared-calendar-events`, `list-user-direct-reports`,
  `list-shared-calendar-view`) interpolated it raw, so `fetch` dropped everything
  from the `#` onward and queried the wrong user. The `userId` segment is now
  percent-encoded (`#`→`%23`, `@`→`%40`; GUIDs unchanged), which Microsoft Graph
  requires for B2B UPNs and which is verified live against the directory. `get-user`
  (new this release) already encodes its path.
- **Cached elevated / substrate tokens now survive a basic-token refresh.** The
  silent basic-token refresh (triggered whenever the Teams token nears expiry)
  rebuilt the cache from only the three basic fields, wiping the cached `elevated`
  / `chatsvcagg` / `ic3` tokens on every renewal — so `scopes-check` and `login`
  then reported them unavailable with empty scopes, and the elevated token (which
  carries no refresh token of its own) needed a forced re-login to recover. The
  refresh now merges, preserving all four tokens until they each expire.
- **`scopes-check` explains an unavailable token.** Every tier block whose
  `available` is `false` now carries a `reason` — a one-line note on why it is
  absent and how to restore it (`login --force`; the substrate tiers also self-heal
  on next use) — so an empty `scopes: []` on a missing token is not misread as "no
  scopes". Additive and non-breaking; omitted when the token is available.

## 2.1.0

### Added

- **`create-forward-draft`** creates an UNSENT forward draft of an existing
  message. `POST /me/messages/{id}/createForward` mints the draft (`FW:` subject,
  quoted original) with your comment placed above the quote and the recipients
  set, in one call (`Mail.ReadWrite`, already on the basic token).
  `--to-recipients` is required (a forward with no recipient is not actionable);
  `--cc-recipients` and a `--subject` override are optional. Like the other
  mail-draft commands, it produces an UNSENT draft only; the CLI can never send.
  This is the fourth and last write command, closing the "forward to the right
  owner" gap that `create-reply-draft` (in-thread) could not.
- **`convert-local-file --include-images`** (a `.zip` only) also extracts every
  archive entry's embedded images (docx/xlsx/pptx OOXML media parts, pdf page
  images), so a screenshot pasted inside a zipped document is reachable in one
  call.
- **`login` now reports all four cached tokens** (basic, elevated/M365, and the
  two Teams-chat substrate tokens chatsvcagg / ic3) with each one's time-left and
  refresh route, so running `login` while already signed in shows the full token
  picture instead of a bare `{ status: "authenticated" }`. Each token is
  `{ available, expiresInSeconds?, refresh: "automatic" | "interactive", reason? }`:
  basic/chatsvcagg/ic3 refresh automatically from the cached refresh token; the
  elevated token is `interactive` (re-captured only on a browser login).
- **`login --force`** ignores the cache and re-captures every token via the
  browser in one pass — the only way to refresh the elevated token while the
  basic token is still valid. The persistent browser profile is reused, so you
  are usually not re-prompted for credentials.
- **`scopes-check` now reports the elevated (M365ChatClient) token** plus the two
  Teams-chat substrate tokens (`chatsvcagg` / `ic3`), each in an
  `{ available, expiresInSeconds? }` block, so a fresh process can pre-flight the
  historical-version download / convert commands instead of discovering a 403
  mid-run. The two substrate blocks are additive; the existing top-level fields
  are unchanged.
- **Machine-readable `errorCode`s on more error paths** — the elevated /
  substrate fail-fast (`secondary_token_unavailable`) and the client-side
  unsupported-input rejections (`unsupported_image` / `unsupported_format` /
  `unsupported_legacy_office` / `unsupported_document`), so an agent branches on
  a stable code instead of substring-matching the message.

### Fixed

- **`create-forward-draft` and `create-reply-draft` no longer drop the forwarded
  / quoted body.** They set the comment via Graph's `comment` parameter on the
  `createForward` / `createReplyAll` POST, which places it above the preserved
  quote. The previous implementation PATCHed `body` with only the comment, which
  **replaced** the whole draft body and dropped the entire forwarded original (a
  forward went out with just the comment, no message). Caught by a live smoke
  test; the fix is live-verified.

### Changed

- The `parseRecipients` helper shared by the mail-draft write commands moved to
  `parse-recipients.ts` (one definition, three call sites), with no behaviour
  change.
- `scopes-check` `responseShape` corrected: `elevated.expiresInSeconds` is
  omitted (the key is absent) when no elevated token is cached, not `null`.

### Removed

- The `--body-content-type` flag on **`create-forward-draft` and
  `create-reply-draft`** is removed. It never affected the quoted body (Graph
  embeds the comment / reply as text above the quote), so it was a no-op on those
  two commands. It remains on `create-mail-draft` and `update-mail-draft`, which
  set the body directly.

## 2.0.0

Breaking auth simplification, a repo-wide privacy scrub (including a rewrite of
the full git history), two new commands, and a headless self-heal for the Teams
chat-substrate tokens.

### BREAKING

- **The CLI binary is renamed `ask-marcel` → `ask-marcel-office`** (matching the
  package name; the bare `ask-marcel` name is freed for future use and no longer
  ships as an alias). Update shell scripts, agent prompts, and skills that invoke
  the old name. npm removes the stale `ask-marcel` bin link on upgrade; if one
  lingers (e.g. bun global installs), delete it manually.
- **`ask-marcel login --use-extension` is removed.** The companion browser
  extension and the system-browser / localhost-callback capture path are gone
  (`browser-extension/`, the `system-browser-auth` + `token-callback-server`
  infra, and the `--use-extension` flag). `ask-marcel-office login` — a
  Playwright-driven Edge/Chrome window that captures all four tokens in one
  session — is the only login flow. The token cache format is unchanged;
  existing sessions keep working without re-login.

### Added

- **`get-schedule`** — free/busy availability for a comma-separated list of
  people and/or meeting rooms over a time window
  (`POST /me/calendar/getSchedule`, `Calendars.Read` — already on the basic
  token). Returns each person's `availabilityView` slot string (0 free /
  1 tentative / 2 busy / 3 OOF / 4 working-elsewhere), the underlying busy
  blocks, and their working hours. Both bounds accept the relative-date
  vocabulary (`today`, `+1d`, `start-of-week`, …).
- **`create-reply-draft`** — create a threaded reply-all draft to an existing
  message (`createReplyAll` + a body patch), so an agent can prepare a response
  in-thread. Produces an UNSENT draft only — like `create-mail-draft` /
  `update-mail-draft`, the CLI can never send. (Third and last write command.)
- **Teams substrate tokens now self-heal on the command path.** When a
  chatsvcagg or ic3 token lapses (~hourly), the CLI redeems the shared Teams
  refresh token for that substrate audience over HTTP — headless, no browser —
  instead of dead-ending in a "run `ask-marcel-office login`" error. The four
  Teams chat commands (`list-teams-chats-with-messages`, `list-teams-chat-messages`,
  `get-teams-chat-message`, `find-chats-with-user`) plus `list-teams-chat-history`
  now keep working for as long as your Graph token does, rather than dying an hour
  into a session. Falls back to the interactive-login prompt only when no refresh
  token is cached or Entra ID rejects the redemption. The elevated token
  (historical-version downloads) is unaffected — a different app identity with no
  shared-RT path — and still needs `login` when it lapses.

### Changed

- The npm tarball no longer double-ships the ~500 KB command manifest:
  `docs/commands.json` was dropped from `files[]` (the importable
  `ask-marcel-office-cli/commands.json` subpath still resolves to
  `dist/commands.json`, which remains). Unpacked size ~3.5 → ~3.0 MB.

### Internal

- Privacy scrub: personal/tenant fixture data and internal audit-session
  labels removed across source, tests, fixtures, and docs — and purged from
  the entire git history (rewritten and force-pushed).
- Dead code removed: the single-token browser capture (`acquireToken`), two
  orphan probe scripts, an unused env module; the four graph-client
  auth-header closures collapsed into one factory.

## 1.5.2

### Fixed

- **`find-chats-with-user` now surfaces cross-tenant 1:1 chats.** An externally-homed
  counterpart comes back from the Teams chat roster as a bare object-id — no name, no
  email — so a name search could never match it, and a real, active 1:1 returned a
  silent `matchCount: 0`. The command now hydrates every bare **direct (1:1)** chat via
  `/chats/{id}/members` and re-runs the match, so a cross-tenant counterpart is found
  even when they were already resolved in a meeting under a different identity. When
  nothing matches but bare members remain, it returns a `hint` + `unresolvedMemberCount`
  rather than a confidently-empty result.
- **`list-chat-members` reads on the basic Teams token** (`ChatMember.Read`) instead of
  the login-only elevated (M365ChatClient) token, so it no longer fails with "Elevated
  token expired" on the command path. `next-page` routes `/chats/{id}/members` cursors on
  the basic token to match. Chat _metadata_ (`list-chats` / `get-chat`) still requires
  the elevated token.

## 1.5.1

### Fixed

- **No browser window opens per command once a secondary token lapses** (completes
  the 1.5.0 auth fix). The elevated / Teams-chat (chatsvcagg / ic3) token recaptures
  each launched a _visible_ browser that "opens and closes within seconds" to
  silently re-capture — per command, per process, with no cross-process throttle —
  so after the short-lived elevated token (~59 min) expired, every elevated or
  Teams-chat command popped a window. The command-path auth now **self-heals** the
  chat-substrate tokens with a headless refresh of the shared Teams RT (and, when
  that can't renew them, fails fast with an actionable "run `ask-marcel-office
  login`") instead; interactive browser capture is reserved for the explicit
  `login` command, which re-captures all four tokens in one session.

## 1.5.0

Agent-ergonomics, a faster cold-start, a new command, and an LLM-safety pass.
Mostly additive; the one rename keeps its old name as an alias. **One behaviour
change to note**: byte commands now refuse to inline a payload over ~1 MB without
`--output-path` (see _Changed_).

### Added

- **`read-mail-attachment`** — a polymorphic "read any attachment" command that
  auto-routes by content-type: a `.zip` is unpacked and every entry converted
  (the `{ count, files }` envelope), everything else (docx/xlsx/pptx/odf/csv/pdf/
  `.msg`/legacy/text, reference + embedded items) runs through the markdown
  dispatch. Images / scanned PDFs / legacy `.ppt` return the actionable
  vision-model hint. Use the explicit `convert-mail-attachment-*` siblings only
  to force a specific output format. (Surface: 176 → 177 commands.)
- **`pageCount`** on the born-digital PDF text envelope (every PDF→markdown entry
  point) so an LLM can chunk its reads without a second parse.
- **`--id`** is now accepted by *every* command with a single required `*-id`
  flag (was mail-message-only) — e.g. `get-calendar-event --id`, `get-team --id`.
- **`--start` / `--end`** aliases for `--start-date-time` / `--end-date-time`
  across the calendar-view family.
- **Token-tier flags in the manifest** — `needsElevatedToken` (now serialized to
  `commands.json` too, not only `help-json`) and a new `needsSubstrateToken` mark
  the Teams elevated / chat-substrate commands, so an agent can warm up an
  interactive login before calling them instead of dead-ending on a timeout.

### Changed

- **`download-onedrive-file-content` → `download-drive-item-content`** (it works
  on any driveItem, not just OneDrive). The old name keeps working as a
  back-compat alias.
- **Friendlier error for a mistyped flag**: a bare word like `item--id` (instead
  of `--item-id`) now explains flags need their leading `--`, rather than
  commander's opaque "too many arguments".
- **Byte commands refuse to inline a multi-MB payload** without `--output-path`:
  `get-mail-attachment`, `get-mail-message-mime`, the `download-*` family, etc.
  now return an actionable `inline_too_large` error above ~1 MB instead of
  flooding an LLM's context with a base64 blob. Small payloads still inline.
- **`read-mail-attachment` prefers content-type when the filename misleads** — a
  real spreadsheet saved as `report.jpg` now converts as a table instead of
  returning an image hint. The explicit `convert-*` siblings stay
  extension-deterministic by design.
- **Unified `--drive-id` guidance** — the 11 terse drive-item commands now point
  at `list-drives` / `list-sharepoint-site-drives` like the rest.

### Fixed

- **Auth no longer pops a browser per command on re-auth.** The primary-token
  refresh-fallback used to launch the Chrome extension-capture window — once per
  process, with no cross-process throttle, so a batch/agent run stacked up windows.
  Command re-auth now uses a headed Edge sign-in only when the silent refresh
  genuinely fails; the extension capture is reserved for explicit `login --use-extension`.
- **Stale doc numbers** — the `help-json` size hints (terse-category ~16 → ~6 KB
  after the trim) and the README command list now match reality.

### Performance

- **Cold-start**: the heavy conversion deps are `--external` to the npm bundle
  (`dist/cli.js` 7.4 MB → 1.2 MB; `node --version` ~1.0 s → 0.58 s). The compiled
  standalone binaries (`build:bin`) stay self-contained.
- **`help-json --terse`** summaries are compacted to their first sentence, so a
  per-category discovery fetch drops well under budget (drive 17.9 KB → 6.5 KB,
  mail 16.8 KB → 5.2 KB; full terse 83 KB → 31 KB).

## 1.0.0

The first stable release. Two breaking changes consolidate the public output
contract; the rest is additive.

### Breaking — output contract

- **Errors emit on stdout**, not stderr. `process.exitCode = 1` still
  distinguishes failure, so shell scripts that branch on the exit code keep
  working — but anything that read errors from stderr (`cmd 2>err.json`) needs
  to merge streams or read stdout instead. An LLM piping `ask-marcel <cmd>
  | jq` no longer needs `2>&1`.
- **Every command output is wrapped in the v1 envelope**:
  - Success: `{ ok: true, data: <payload>, nextLink?: string, count?: number }`
  - Error: `{ ok: false, error: "<message>" }`

  `@odata.nextLink` and `@odata.count` from the underlying Graph payload are
  lifted to the top of the envelope and removed from `data`. Consumers who
  parsed `value[0]` as the first item now read `data.value[0]`.

### Added — OData query passthrough on every list/search command

Every `list-*` / `search-*` / `get-*-delta` command now accepts the six
standard OData query parameters as optional flags, so an LLM can shrink large
responses on the fly:

```
--top <n>       maximum items per page
--skip <n>      offset
--select <csv>  comma-separated field list (huge payload-size win)
--filter <kql>  server-side predicate
--orderby <kql> sort expression
--expand <nav>  inline navigation properties
```

Four commands keep `buildCommand` because their hard-coded `$filter` would
collide with a user-supplied `--filter`: `list-conversation-messages`,
`list-incomplete-todo-tasks`, `list-incomplete-planner-tasks`,
`search-onenote-pages`.

### Added — `my-quick-context`

New meta command that issues five Graph calls in parallel (`/me`, `/me/drive`,
`/me/mailFolders/inbox`, `/me/todo/lists`, `/me/calendar`) and returns
`{ user, primaryDriveId, inboxId, todoLists, primaryCalendarId }` in one
round trip. Replaces the audit's 5-call discovery chain.

### Fixed

- `microsoft-search-query` no longer 400s. Splits `entityTypes` into two
  `requests[]` entries so Graph stops rejecting `person` mixed with
  file/mail/event types.
- `list-conversation-messages` no longer trips Graph's `InefficientFilter`.
  Drops the `$orderby=receivedDateTime` from the OData query.
- `list-sharepoint-site-items` is removed. Microsoft Graph has no list-less
  site/items collection endpoint; `get-sharepoint-site-item`'s docstring now
  points at the two-step discovery chain
  (`list-sharepoint-site-lists` → `list-sharepoint-site-list-items`) that
  Graph actually supports.
- `list-groups` summary no longer advertises a `--top` flag it didn't
  register. Project-wide invariant added so every `--flag` mentioned in any
  command summary must be a real option or alias on that command.
- `next-page` routes nextLinks under `/me/chats` and `/chats/...` via the
  elevated M365ChatClient token. Chat pagination no longer 403s.
- `search-onenote-pages` accepts `--query` as an alias for
  `--title-substring`, matching the convention used by every other search
  command.

### Added — flag aliases

- `--todo-list-id` is now accepted by every command that takes
  `--todo-task-list-id` (`--task-list-id` alias preserved).
- `get-sharepoint-site-item` accepts `--list-item-id` (alias for `--item-id`).
  `get-sharepoint-site-list-item` accepts `--item-id` (alias for
  `--list-item-id`). LLMs that write either spelling from memory now hit the
  right flag.

### Quality

- Bun `JSON.stringify` already escapes every U+0000–U+001F control character
  and U+2028 / U+2029 separator. The audit's "raw control chars" claim in
  the four insight commands does not reproduce against the actual code path;
  regression-guard tests pin the contract.
