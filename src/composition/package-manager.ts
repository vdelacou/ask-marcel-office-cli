/*
 * Heuristic detection of which package manager originally installed the CLI.
 * Used by the `ask-marcel update` command to invoke the matching install
 * tool (`npm i -g …` vs `bun add -g …`).
 *
 * Heuristic: if the bin path contains a `.bun` segment, it is a bun-installed
 * global; otherwise default to npm. This is good enough — the worst case is
 * the user installs via one tool and the update routes through the other,
 * which still produces an updated copy in the other tool's prefix; the user
 * can re-run with the original tool to clean up.
