/*
 * Probe: does any first-party app Outlook Web loads emit a Graph-audience
 * bearer carrying `Mail.Read.Shared`?
 *
 * Why this exists. The five `list-shared-mailbox-*` commands need the delegated
 * `Mail.Read.Shared` scope and answer `ErrorAccessDenied` without it. The CLI
 * owns no app registration, so a scope cannot be requested: it captures bearers
 * that Microsoft's own web apps emit, and a scope is reachable exactly when some
 * harvestable first-party app already carries it. That ceiling has moved once
 * before (OfficeHome carries `Contacts.Read` where the Teams client does not,
 * see the comment above ELEVATED_APP_IDS in src/infra/browser-auth.ts), so the
 * question is empirical, not architectural.
 *
 * What it does. Opens the same persistent browser profile `login` uses, loads
 * Outlook Web, and decodes every outgoing `Authorization: Bearer` header the way
 * browser-auth.ts does. It reports, per appid, the audiences seen and the scopes
 * granted.
 *
 * What it never does. Print, log or persist a token. Only decoded `appid`,
 * `aud` and `scp` claims are shown. It navigates read-only and sends nothing.
 *
 * Run:  bun run scripts/probe-outlook-scopes.ts
 *       bun run scripts/probe-outlook-scopes.ts --headless
 *
 * A first run may need an interactive sign-in; leave the window open until the
 * mailbox has rendered.
 *
 * RESULT, 2026-09-06, one tenant. Outlook Web emits a Graph-audience bearer
 * under appid 9199bf20-a13f-4107-85dc-02114787ef48 carrying `Mail.ReadWrite.Shared`
 * and `Mail.Send.Shared` (not `Mail.Read.Shared`), alongside roughly a hundred
 * others including `Mail.Send`, `Files.ReadWrite.All` and `Group.ReadWrite.All`.
 * So the scope IS reachable. See `probe-outlook-shared-read.ts` for why that
 * does not settle the question, and why the answer is still no.
 *
 * Capture is opportunistic, and this is the hard part. The appid emits bearers
 * on nearly every load but almost always for a NON-Graph audience; across
 * 2026-09-06 the Graph-audience mint happened only on the day's first cold
 * start. Waiting longer does not help, nor does reloading, nor does clearing the
 * origin's web storage to force MSAL to re-acquire. Run this first thing,
 * against a profile that has not opened Outlook yet that day. A run that reports
 * the appid with "(no Graph audience)" is this, not a broken probe.
